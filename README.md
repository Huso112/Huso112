# Hello, GitHub!

Hi.

I am an (Arch) Linux user & programming language enthusiast.

I started programming last summer for hobby but I think I'll be an software engineer. 

My first language is Python but if we can sat shells, then my fist language is Bash. I writed a lot of Bash script in past.

I wrote some programs -thanks to the people who helped me- especially in Python but it was so slow to me and I learned C++ ;  after C++ and currently I am learning Rust.

## Programming Languages I (Intermedidately Know And) Use
- JS
- Python
- C++
- Rust
